README

First of all we have to check if we have all required software for this application. I guess java is already configured, but just in case, I will outline how to be able to execute the whole program. 

First, download apache-maven-3.3.3 from the following webpage: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

I have been working with MAC OS, since it is a UNIX OS, will perfectly work on Linux.
Once we have it downloaded, we can proceed to compile and execute the program with these commands:

Once you are placed in the cs445 directory (where is the pom.xml file) run the following command:

$ mvn clean

To run the test and the coverage write:

$ mvn clean cobertura:cobertura

It will generate some files. The ones that we are interested are two:
	
	- "edu.iit.cs445.Test.VinTest.txt", which is located in cs445/target/surefire-reports/

	- "index.html", located in cs445/target/site/cobertura/

Finally run:

$ mvn install

After that you will be ready to run the program executing the following, but first you need to give the right privileges to the script:
$ chmod +x vinClub.sh
$ ./vinClub.sh [commands]

and the corresponding commands for each use case that are described as follows:

-subscriber : commands for subscriber
